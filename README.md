# Overview of ride sharing analysis

### The purpose of the new analysis is to gather the data of the first four months of ride shares and turn it into useful data to look at. We pulled out the totals for each area of urban, suburban, and rural ride shares. We found the average fares each area and driver makes.

## The Results

### There's a distinct difference in the three areas for amount of rides and fares. Even though Rural has the highest average fare it has considerably less fares and makes the least fare of all three. Even with the lower fares, suburban makes less per fare and average fare than urban by a lot. The highest suburban fares do not even surpass the lowest fares of urban's averages. There's 500 more fares in suburban than that of rural and a thousand more urban fares than suburban. From the data gathered, the average price is less but there's many more rides that makes a noticeable difference fares gathered.

## Analysis Summary

### There's a few weeks to focus on that could benefit from more drivers, potentially bringing in more fares. The third week of January, the first and last week of February, the second week of March and the first week of April are all big weeks for Rural. This doesn't match in suburban and urban city types completely, in fact some of those bigger weeks in rural are smaller weeks for suburban or urban. With more years collected we could see a trend and focus more time and drivers on bigger weeks by knowing the general events coming up that match those dates.
